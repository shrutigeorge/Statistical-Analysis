# Statistical-Analysis
Includes selected R scripts developed as a part of my curriculum.
The scripts demonstrate the application of statistical theory, categorical data analysis, and exploratory data analysis using real-world inspired datasets (from Kaggle).

## Projects Included

### 1. Spam Email Classification Using Categorical Data Analysis
**File:** `spamclassify.R`

This script applies binomial and categorical data analysis techniques to a large-scale email dataset to study spam classification patterns.

**Key Concepts & Methods**
- Binomial distribution modeling for binary outcomes
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for spam probability
- Exact binomial confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing on proportions
- Chi-square tests for independence
- Feature categorization and association analysis
- Data visualization using base R

**Key Insights**
- Overall spam rate estimation with confidence bounds
- Strong association between spam likelihood and:
  - Number of links
  - Presence of offer-related keywords
  - Use of all-capitalized subject lines
- Identification of statistically significant predictors of spam behavior
  
**Domain:** Cybersecurity / Email Filtering  
**Dataset Size:** ~20,000 emails (synthetic, obtained from Kaggle)

### 2. Behavioral Data Analysis Using R
**File:** `behaviouralscience.R`

This script performs exploratory, univariate, and bivariate analysis on a behavioral science dataset to examine relationships between personality traits, demographics, and substance use patterns.

**Key Concepts & Methods**
- Univariate analysis of numerical and categorical variables
- Conversion of continuous psychological scores into ordered categorical scales
- Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions
- Correlation analysis between personality traits
- Contingency tables for categorical associations
- Bivariate analysis using boxplots and aggregation functions
- Data visualization in R

**Key Insights**
- Distribution of personality traits across demographic groups
- Relationships between personality traits and substance use behaviors
- Identification of trends through categorical and numerical comparisons

**Domain:** Behavioural Science / Psychology  
**Dataset Size:** 130 respondents (obtained from Kaggle)
